## Summary

Predicting the occupancy of surface lots with convolutional neural networks.

This repository is a project I did for a data science course at Ohio State. The Jupyter notebooks train neural nets (FCN or CNN) on mock satellite images of surface lots. 

The training data consists of simple computer-generated images of surface lots. These images are then randomly tagged to label the occupancy of the parking spaces.
